# Metasift

Metasift is a metadata extraction tool.

Python 3.10.7

> LIMITED FEATURES: This app currently has limited features and only supports
> `.docx` files at the moment. It will be expanded in the future to include
> more filetypes. My current focus is on getting batch processing implemented,
> and then working on cleaning metadata for `.docx` files before moving onto
> other filetypes.

## Features

âœ… - Extract metadata from `.docx` files <br />
âœ… - Remove password protection from `.docx` files <br />
âœ… - _Coming Soon_ Batch processing <br />

#### Password Protection Removal

When removing passwords from `.docx` files, Metasift will not modify the original
file in order to prevent any potential for corrupting the file. It will instead
create a new `/unlocked-documents` directory where it will store the unlocked version.

## Quickstart

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nronzel/metasift.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd metasift
```

### Dependencies

### Usage

Run Metasift by running the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

or

```bash
python3 main.py
```
